Basics of Git and Github

pull request to make changes to something hosted on github

Useful Git Commands:

git init
- to initialize a repository in your directory

git checkout -b main
- create a main branch rather than master default
- main branch is typical head branch. can checkout other branch for development features.

git status
- show current branch, list of commits, and any untracked files

git add
- add specified file to staging area for future commits

git commit -m "message"
- commits file with commit comment

git log
- shows commit history

git rm --cached <file>
- remove specified file(s) from staging area

git restore <file>
- restore file to discard changes in working directory to last commit

git branch
- list all branches for the current repository

git diff
- show differences between recent commit and changed files
- use "--staged" to only see differences in the staged area

git reset <file>
- remove file from staging area

to make a file not tracked by git, you can make a hidden file called ".gitignore" and list any files not to be tracked there. you need to add and commit the .gitinore file for things not to be tracked.

Using Github:

Create new repository on Github

git remote add origin <SSH_KEY FROM GITHUB> 
- adds remote server push pull connection to github

git remote -v
- see current origin

git push origin main
- push current branch to the github repository
